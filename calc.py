from tkinter import *
This line imports all the classes and functions from the tkinter module, allowing us to use them in our code.

expression = ''
This variable expression will store the mathematical expression that the user enters.

def press(userinput):
    global expression
    expression = expression + str(userinput)
    equation.set(expression)
This function is called when a button representing a digit or an operator is clicked. It updates the expression variable by appending the clicked value, converts it to a string, and sets the value of the equation variable, which is used to update the display field.

def equalPress():
    try:
        global expression
        result = eval(expression)
        equation.set(result)
        expression = str(result)
    except:
        equation.set("error")
This function is called when the equal button (=) is clicked. It evaluates the expression using the eval() function, which interprets the expression as a Python code and returns the result. If the expression is valid, it sets the result as the value of the equation variable and updates the expression variable. If there is an error (e.g., dividing by zero), it sets the equation variable to "error".

def clear():
    global expression
    expression = ""
    equation.set(expression)
This function is called when the clear button (c) is clicked. It clears the expression variable and sets the equation variable to an empty string, effectively clearing the display.

gui = Tk()
gui.title("simple calculator")
gui.geometry("280x250")
These lines create the main window of the calculator application using the Tk() class from the tkinter module. It sets the window title to "simple calculator" and the window size to 280x250 pixels.

titleLabel = Label(gui, text="Simple calculator", fg="blue", font="century 18 bold")
titleLabel.grid(columnspan=4, pady=20)
These lines create a label widget to display the title of the calculator. It sets the text to "Simple calculator", the foreground color to blue, and the font to "century 18 bold". The grid() method is used to specify the layout of the widget within the grid system of the window.

equation = StringVar()
expressionField = Entry(gui, textvariable=equation)
expressionField.grid(columnspan=4, padx=5, pady=10, ipadx=70)
These lines create an entry widget, which is used as the display field for the calculator. The StringVar() class is used to create a special variable (equation) that will be linked to the entry widget. The grid() method is used to specify the layout of the widget within the grid system of the window.

btn1 = Button(gui, text=' 1 ', command=lambda: press(1), height=1, width=7)
btn1.grid(row=2, column=0)
...
These lines create the buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), decimal point (.), equal ðŸ˜Š), and clear (c). The Button() class is used to create each button, and the command parameter specifies the function to be called when the button is clicked. The grid() method is used to specify the layout of the buttons within the grid system of the window.

gui.mainloop()
This line starts the main event loop of the GUI, which listens for user interactions and updates the display accordingly. It keeps the window open & responsive until it is closed by the user
